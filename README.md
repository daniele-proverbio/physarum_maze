Code to reproduce the numerical results for "Threshold sensing yields optimal path formation in Physarum polycephalum â€“ but the mould does not know"

The code is adapted from a previously optimised ODE solver for similar problems, by David Palma (as acknowledged in the source code). This repository hosts code for reproducibility purposes only.
